Adopt @napplet/core 0.41.x and @napplet/nap 0.40.x, which export the current NAP-INTENT no-ID, string-sender delivery. `@kehto/services` now re-exports its intent types from `@napplet/core` instead of keeping a local copy. Because core releases before 0.41.0 carry the withdrawn delivery ID and nullable sender, `@kehto/services`, `@kehto/paja` and `@kehto/cli` now require `@napplet/core` >=0.41.0. Other packages widen their peer windows to core <0.42.0 and nap <0.41.0 and move development builds and JSR maps to the new line. The shell's injected intent receiver now drops deliveries with an empty sender, matching the nap 0.40 binding.
